The purpose of this paper was to examine different types of label noises and the algorithms in
addressing those noises. There appeared three main types of label noise including uniform, classconditional
and instance-dependent noise. Label noise has an adverse impact on the performance
of the algorithm including the weak accuracy rate, long processing time and the interpretability of
the classifier. The project first constructs a useful dataset which could be deployed when studying
both class-conditional (CCN) and instance-and label-dependent noise (ILN). The project aims at
the reimplementation of some of the recent algorithms including label-dependent cost (Natarajan
et al., 2013), Importance Reweighting method introduced by Liu et al. (2016) and the Instance
Label Dependent method by Cheng et al. (2017). Using the constructed dataset, the project
compared the performance of different algorithms for both CCN and ILN. Through the
reimplementation, the project hopes to discuss the application of some of the algorithms, the
compatibility between the algorithm and the type of noise and potential real-world datasets for
understanding label noise.
This report would include many sections previously discussed in the Project Proposal as well as
the Project Progress. Building upon that information, the report will elaborate on those details
further to help provide a clearer picture of label noise problem.
Keywords: label noise, importance reweighting, instance, and class dependent noise.
